### Why Astro?

Astro is a perfect framework to use if you are making a content-based website, since it's server-side, HTML-first and it lets you add JavaScript just when you need it. In my case, I have a ton of JavaScript, because I'm using framer-motion to animate my portfolio page. However, I intend to add more static content to subfolders.

Even though most of the code is client-side - it's hard to call it idiomatic use of Astro - I have still noticed a performance improvement comparing this version to React + Vite.
